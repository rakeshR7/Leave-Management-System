      <h3>About OD Leave  Management System</h3>
      <p>A Leave Management System automates the leave request process, making it hassle-free for both the management and the employees. The solution of your choice should be robust enough to seamlessly handle all the stages involved in a leave management process: application, approval/rejection, filing leaves, managing leave balance, and analysis. A good leave management system will have the following functionalities:</p>
      <p>Navigating the leave management minefield without a leave management system is a tricky challenge. When youâ€™re equipped only with conventional tools like paper forms, emails, and excel sheets, your chances of survival are pretty low. Even small missteps can cause disasters like resource crunch, payroll processing errors, and legal complications.</p>
      <p>Despite the high impact on productivity and employee engagement, SMBs are not ready to revamp their awkward manual process of handling leave requests. At several SMBs, the employees are still running behind their managers with leave forms to get a signature. Whereas, the managers are scurrying around excel sheets to figure out leave balances.</p>
      <p>Although some employers want to keep employees at work all the time, they need their fair share of time-off to rest and recuperate. An overworked employee is an unproductive one. Leave management is the process of managing employee time-off requests in a fair, accurate, and efficient way.</p>
